# Project 0

The project consists of 4 pages about the life and achievements of Lionel messi (Home, Bibliography, Achievement and Statistics). There is a navigation bar to access between all pages using hyperlinks: 

- The first page, is the home page, called index.html. In this page we use ***nesting*** with scss in such a way to only apply the change to the "list" class, to those elements that are within the footer class, this can be seen in ***style2.css***, this file was geneterated with ***style2.scss*** that use SCSS variables and inheritance. On this page we can find an unordered list, and an image which makes use of a ***mobile-responsive @media query***, to change the size of the image on small screens.
- The second page, corresponds to the biography of lionel messi, which contains boostrap components for the buttons specifically use the classes ***("btn btn-primary btn-lg").***
- The third page corresponds to achievements, in which we can find ***ordered lists***.
- Finally, on the fourth sheet that contains the statistics of Lionel Messi's sports career, we can find a table that uses two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using ***Bootstrap's grid model***, this allows us to pass one table below another to present them on smaller screens.

**Note:** In the different stylesheets, we can see the use of at least five different CSS properties, and at least five different types of CSS selectors. The use of the #id selector was used on the buttons, and the .class selector was used several times on the style sheets.
