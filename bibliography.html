    <p class="paragraph">
        Luis Lionel Andres (“Leo”) Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and
        the Argentina national team. At the age of 13, Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC Barcelona agreed to
        pay for his medical treatments.
        There he earned renown as one of the greatest players in history, helping his club win more than two dozen
        league titles and tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar year, and in 2016, he was
        named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the fifth time.

    <p class="paragraph">
        Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older
        brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of 8, he was recruited
        to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a Rosario-based club.

        Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was eventually diagnosed by doctors as
        suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a
        regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several
        hundred dollars per month for the medication.

    <p class="paragraph">
        So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth
        academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the
        Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly
        through the junior system ranks.

    <p class="paragraph">
        Ultimately, Messi's short stature (5 feet, 7 inches), combined with his speed and relentless attacking style,
        has drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer, Diego Maradona.
